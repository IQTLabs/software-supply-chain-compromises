# Software Supply Chain Compromises - A Living Dataset

The .csv file in this repository represents the work by IQT Labs to identify and create a
living (though not breathing) dataset of publicly reported software supply chain compromises.
Dan Geer, Bentz Tozer, and John Speed Meyers used this dataset for an article
analyzing software supply chain compromises. (See the citation below.)

We want and need help to maintain this dataset. Please help us maintain it by submitting
pull requests to identify mistakes we made (we're all too human) either of commission or
by omission. Importantly, this dataset will quickly go out of date unless new attacks are
added.
